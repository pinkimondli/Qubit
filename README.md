# Qubit

Understanding a simple singlet-triplet qubit.

Qubit-eigenstates are S,T0. Rabi oscillations are driven by g-factor differences g1-g2, hence require a large detuning. Equatorial oscillations arise due to the exchange interaction J, which is larger at small detuning.

The spin-orbit interaction couples S wiht TM and TP. This gives rise to additional oscillatory terms which we want to understand.

Alternatively, a S-TM qubit can be constructed if the spin-orbit interaction is sizeable.
